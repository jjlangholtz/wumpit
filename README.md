## INTRODUCTION

Deep within a maze of caverns and twisting tunnels lives a creature known as the Wumpit. Protected by giant bats and pits of slime, the Wumpit feeds on unwary visitors to its cavern.

You are the hunter who tracks the Wumpit to its lair! Armed with five grenades, you explore the maze of caverns, searching for clues to tell you where the Wumpit is hiding. Once you think you've found the Wumpit, you throw your grenade into its cavern.

The Wumpit on Rails combines the excitement of a hunt with a new more engaging interface.

Play each game in a new, randomly generated maze. Choose a maze based on your own level of skill (coming soon). Challenge your powers of deduction, memory, and concentration with Wumpit.

## GETTING STARTED

Option Selection

In the initial release you can choose from only one option. In future releases we plan to make the game easier by providing a full map to view where you are and where you have been in the cave as well as adding more challenging caves for increasing difficulty.

Version 1.0 - The "Blindfold" option tests your memory by erasing the map behind you. Only the cavern or tunnel segment you are in appears on the screen.
